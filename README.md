# India_Rainfall_Analysis


The average rainfall in India is 118 cm according to annual data from the Meteorological Department.

Average annual rainfall is 300–650 millimetres (11.8–25.6 in), but is very unreliable; as in much of the rest of India, the southwest monsoon accounts for most precipitation.

As they hit the Indian peninsula, they cause the southwest or Indian summer monsoon. The summer monsoon winds split into two arms with one travelling over the Arabian sea, while the other moves over the Bay of Bengal. The Arabian sea arm causes rainfall all along India's western coast.

The analysis will help you to understand the rainfall in india very well.
